## üß† Project Overview

**Smart PWM Generator SoC** is a system that integrates **Non-Volatile Memory (NVM)** for persistent PWM pattern storage and instant-on operation.  

This design demonstrates how embedded NVM can enhance system reliability and enable energy-efficient, intelligent control in **automotive**, **medical**, and **edge computing** environments.  

At power-up, the SoC automatically retrieves pre-stored PWM duty cycles or waveform patterns from **BM Labs‚Äô ReRAM IP** and drives the outputs accordingly ‚Äî without requiring external firmware reload or volatile configuration memory.

This approach significantly **reduces initialization time**, **saves power**, and provides **robust recovery** after unexpected resets or power losses.
